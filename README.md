# Shopify Frontend Developer Intern Challenge

## The Challenge

You will write an app that sends plain text prompts to the OpenAI API and displays the results in a list.

### Requirements

We'd like your app to have a simple-to-use interface that includes the following:
- A form for entering text prompts
- Submitting the form sends the prompt to the OpenAI API
- Results are displayed in a list, sorted from newest to oldest. Each result should include the original prompt and a response from the API.

### Extras

- Save responses if the user leaves or reloads the page
- Let the user choose the AI engine from a select box
- Add some presets for the user to quickly send a good prompt
- Make the app more specific to a single purpose. See the OpenAI Examples and prompt design docs for inspiration.

## The App

I will create a React app using technologies and more listed below

- Axios
- Sass
- UUID
- OpenAI
- LocalStorage
